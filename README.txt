Catalog Application Version 1.0 09/07/2015

## Section 1 Intro:
    This catalog application was built using most of the lessons in Udacity's Fullstack nanodegree.
    Information about the program is here: https://www.udacity.com/course/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd004
    It creates a catalog application with a simple category and subcategory relationship along with authentication
    and authorization.

## Section 2 Requirements:
    Vagrant VM installed.
    Python Installed
    sudo pip install werkzeug==0.8.3
    sudo pip install flask==0.9
    sudo pip install Flask-Login==0.1.3


## Section 3 Installation:
    Download the zip (assuming you haven't done already)
    Step1: Navigate to catalog folder with VM
    Step2: Type "python catalog.py"
    Step3: Using a browser navigate to "http://localhost:8000"

## Section 4: Set up
    The catalog.zip file includes a sample db with two user accounts already created.
    If you desire you can run "python catalog_db_setup.py" to set up the db from scratch.


## Section 5: Usage
    Once you've logged into the application using Google authentication you can create categories
    and subcategories of anything you like. The application will keep a relationship between them
    and also keep track of the owner/creator.
